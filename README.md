Food waste has become a habit. Buying more food than we need and letting those groceries spoil in our kitchen has become a big problem for many people. Reducing food loss and waste is essential in a world where millions of people go hungry everyday.

Our idea is to create a space for people where they can easily track the expiration date of the products they have and use them efficiently before they expire.

Often, we check labels on the items, and throw out anything that’s a month, or a week, or maybe a few days past the expiry date on the label. 
The problem was obvious  jam or almond milk or package of cheese had “expired” and the fix was simple: Into the garbage it goes.


An application that can help people track what’s in their fridge or pantry and consume it before it expires and at the same time use them efficiently because of the features like 
- Recipe suggestions on the basis of what’s in the Store room,
- Notifying to the user about Expiry dates of the products,
- Giving nutrition insights of the product user searches for, 
- And many more.
